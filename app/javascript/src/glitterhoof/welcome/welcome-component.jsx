      Ever finish an epic hundred-hour long campaign of CK2 and want a record
      of the trials and travails of your dynasty? You ask the game to export a
      copy of your family chronicle only to find it's a boring text file. What
      if you could make it a bit more fancy, and also get some stat crunching
      on the events that shaped your clan and history itself? Enter
      Glitterhoof: the app for giving that dusty old chronicle some much
      needed pizazz.
